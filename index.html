  <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="index">
    <p>Now rendering subview {{model.subView}}</p>

    <p>
      Render with a string works:
      {{render "sub1" }}
    <p>

    <p>
      Render with a model attribute (that returns a string) does not:
      {{render model.subView }}
    <p>

    <p>
      Template with a string works:
      {{template "sub1" }}
    <p>

    <p>
      Template with a model attribute does not:
      "template model.subView" would throw an error
    <p>

    <p>
      View with a string works:
      {{view 'App.Sub1View'}}
    <p>

    <p>
      View with a property returning that string does not:
      trying {{ model.subViewClassName }}<br>
      "view model.subViewClassName" throws:
      Error: assertion failed: You must pass a view to the #view helper, not model.subViewClassName (App.Sub1View) 
    <p>

    <p>
      View with a property returning the view class finally works:
      {{view model.subViewClass}}
    <p>

    <p>
      But then I ran in various other issues, mostly about timing.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that I tried manually observing the loaded model and rendering the view,
      which broke depending on wether the model or the view was created first,
      (no code example) and finally ran into
      the solution (that the removal of defaultContainer killed):

      {{ view Ember.ContainerView currentViewBinding="subViewClass" }}
    </p>

    <p>
      Now please open Chrome dev console and click on the links below:
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="#1">1</a>
      <a href="#2">2</a>
      <a href="#3">3</a>
      <br>
      A real page reload with the #ids works fine by the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I honestly have no idea, why the last example doesn't work in this context.
      It did fine in my production code. Maybe you know why ...
    </p>
